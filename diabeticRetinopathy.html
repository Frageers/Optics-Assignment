        <p>Diabetic retinopathy is when the amount of sugar in the blood is too much that the blood vessels that nourish the retina get clogged up</p>
        <p>when this happens, the eye tries to make more blood vessels but can't make ones that properly function</p>
        <p>Notice darks spots in your vision</p>
        <p>Vision gets blurrier</p>
        <p>IF not caught in time, may lead to vision loss</p>

        <p>There are 2 surgeries you can do to treat it</p>
        <p>You can either use freezing to fix / mend the retina and then use a air bubble to keep the retina in place so it heals properly</p>
