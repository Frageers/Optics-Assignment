        <h2 class="subHeader">What is Glaucoma</h2>
        <p>Glaucoma is the damage of the optical nerve caused by pressur in the eye</p>
        <p>This pressure is caused by the buildup of aqueous fluid in the eye and not being drained out</p>
        <p>When this happens, the optical nerve has a hard time converting light into electrical signal which tells the brain what to see and where</p>
        
        <h2 class="subHeader">What are the causes of Glaucoma</h2>
        <p>Glaucoma is caused when the aqueous fluid in the eye doesn't drain out normally</p>
        <p>This increases pressure in the eye and causes damage to the optical nerve</p>
    
        <h2 class="subHeader">How will Glaucoma affect your life</h2>
        <p>Glaucoma will cause blind spots in your vision over time</p>
        <p>In the final stages of Glaucoma, full vision loss will occur</p>
    
        <h2 class="subHeader">Treatment for Glaucoma</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of Glaucoma</p>
        <p>The main goal of Glaucoma treatment is to stop the progression or slow down the progression of Glaucoma</p>
        <p>There are 2 main types of surgeries that doctors do to treat Glaucoma</p>
        <p>Laser Surgery:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Laser surgery is obviously done with the help of a laser</li>
            <li>The eye is numbed with the help of eye drops and then a laser is used to drain out the extra fluid</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Traditonal surgey is based off of incsisions that help drain the fluid out</p>
        
        <p align="center"><strong>THESE SURGERIES DO NOT REMOVE GLAUCOMA AND INSTEAD STOP IT OR SLOW IT DOWN. IT IS STILL IMPORTANT TO GET REGULAR CHECK UPS AFTER YOU GET THE SURGERY</strong></p>
