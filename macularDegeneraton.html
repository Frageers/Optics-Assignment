        <h2 class="subHeader">What is Macular Degeneration</h2>
        <p>Degeneration of the Macula in the eye which is responsible for the central vision</p>
        <p>When this happens, the optical nerve isnt getting the light from the retina for the central part of your vision</p>
        <p>That light isnt converted into the electrical signal which is how we see</p>
        
        <h2 class="subHeader">What are the causes?</h2>
        <p>Usually related to age</p>
        <p>Higher risk if you are caucasian, have diabetes</p>
        <p>Can also be caused by a head injury or if your diet doesnt have sufficient nutrients</p>
        
        <h2 class="subHeader">How will it affect your daily life</h2>
        <p>You will start to see straight lines as curved</p>
        <p>If not treated, you will lose your central vision</p>
        <p>Until then,  it will be harder and harder to do everyday tasks like cooking and cleaning</p>
        <p>Will also create blind spots in your vision</p>
        
        <h2 class="subHeader">Treatments for Macular Degeneration</h2>
        <p>There are only treatmentrs that exist for wet Macular Degeneration</p>
        <p>One possible treatment is to use lasers</p>
        <p>The doctor will numb your eyes and put in a special contact lens that helps guide the laser to the abonromal blood clots and remove them / block them</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second option is to use VGEF medicine</p>
        <p>The doctor will numb your eyes then clean them</p>
        <p>The medicine will be inserted through a small needle</p>
